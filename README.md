# JavaScript 2
This is my CA for JavaScript 2

In this CA I  have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but I have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). I will need to register an account and login to access my token.

To complete the required features, I will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.
